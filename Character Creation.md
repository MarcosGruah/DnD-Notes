### **Level Selection**

Choose a starting level between **0 and 3**:

- **Level 0:** No class yet, still discovering your path.
- **Level 1:** Just started training in your class.
- **Level 2:** Gained real experience in combat.
- **Level 3:** Have a subclass and refined skills.

For each level, provide a short paragraph on how you acquired your abilities.

#### **Example Progression:**

- **Level 0:** Worked as a courier, training with a stick in my free time, always dreaming of becoming a warrior.
- **Level 1:** After being ambushed by goblins, I was saved by Sir Stonehill, who took me in as his disciple. He taught me how to defend myself (**Defense Feat**), how to better train my body and mind for combat (**Second Wind**), and the importance of being able to fight with any weapon at my disposal (**Weapon Mastery**).
- **Level 2:** While visiting Lord Noradorâ€™s mansion with Sir Stonehill, we were ambushed. He was wounded, but I escaped using strategy and quick thinking (**Tactical Mind**) and pushed beyond my limits to defeat the captain of the guard (**Action Surge**).
- **Level 3:** Now on my own, I have sharpened my swordplay (**Improved Critical**) and pushed my physical training to new heights (**Remarkable Athlete**) to prepare for vengeance.

Including ability names is optional, but they should fit naturally into the narrative.

# **Species**

The world is primarily populated by **Dwarves, Elves, and Humans**, with **Gnomes and Halflings** being less common but still integrated into society.

I'm open to **Dragonborn, Orcs, and Tieflings**, though some adjustments may be needed (which is totally fine).

**Aasimar and Goliaths** are not available for player characters unless you have a strong reason, in which case we can work something out.

##Species Age

For the most part, all species have the same average lifespan assuming a normal life and natural death.
